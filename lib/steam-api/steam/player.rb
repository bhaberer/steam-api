      # @param [Hash] params Parameters to pass to the API
      # @option params [Fixnum] :steamid The 64 bit ID of the player. (Optional)
      # @option params [Integer] :include_appinfo (0) Whether or not to include
      #   additional details of apps - name and images.
      # @option params [Boolean] :include_played_free_games (false) Whether or
      #   not to list free-to-play games in the results.
      # @option params [Array] :appids_filter You can optionally filter the list
      #   to a set of appids.
